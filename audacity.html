                    <p>
                        <span>My Project:</span>  In total, I used 23 channels  to create my sound story, using f=royalty-free audio clips that were available online.  For my multitrack sound story, I sourced my sound samples from various website’s that offered royalty free samples and background music on the internet such as freesound.org, purple-planet.com, zapsplat.com, and epidemicsound.com. From these websites, I relentlessly searched for suitable sound samples that fitted the story I wanted to depict, and downloaded them to my Audio Editing sound folder that I created for storing free sound sample downloads for this assignment. I amalgamated these clips together and curated the sound story by imprementing audio editing techniques that we learned from our IMD Workshop class and tutorial videos.
                    </p>
                

                <p><span>The Goal:</span> The aim of the project was to curate a sound story and implement editing techniques using free audio samples we sourced online. I did this with the goal of telling a story that the listener could connect with and comprehend without any visual propmt.
                    </p>
                 <p><span>Reflection & Challenges :</span> Audio Editing was a completely new skill I acquired while undertaking this assignment. With this in mind, it took alot of revision of tutorials we were provided with and lecture resources to get the hang of using the Audacity software. Furthermore, ammalgamating a sound story without visual prompts was the main challenge I experienced. However, since this was completely new to me, I am happy with the final outcome! I learned alot from this assignment and the editing skills we gained were positively reflected on our final output for our Product Proposal Video.

                <p><p><span>Sound Story Illustrated:</span> The Covid-19 ward is overpopulated with extremely sick victims, and front-line workers are maxed out with the high capacity of infected persons. Wheezing, coughing, and gasping can be heard from suffering infected individuals from every corner of the ward, as well as the beeps from the ventilator machines giving oxygen to those who need support breathing. Suddenly, a rattling hospital trolley is rushed through the ward with a patient gasping for air. He is severely sick and needs urgent attention. The ward is notified of the urgency, as a speaker announcement calls doctors to the emergency room/ ICU. The distressed patient is carried through the hospital corridor on the trolley to the alternative ward, losing the ability to breathe during this journey. He is gradually losing consciousness. As he is taken in, the curtains are abruptly pulled and the door of the emergency room slams. Doctor’s mumble amongst each other while encouragement is given to the infected victim to breath. The doctors start up the ventilator, and adjust the settings to maximum support. 
                    </p>
                <p> The panicked atmosphere of the emergency room and the efforts the doctors are making to keep their patient alive suddenly flips to all focus being on the patient and his last moments. He is numb, only being able to hear his strained breathing through the respiratory mask. The ventilator continues to pump oxygen into his lungs and keep him alive. The victim’s fading heartbeat come’s into dual focus as the heartbeat monitor detects his loss of life. The heartbeat monitor hits a flatline as the patient passes, being ultimately defeated by the deadly virus. A moment of mourning follows to capsulise the tragedy of his death and this closing chapter of his life.</p>
