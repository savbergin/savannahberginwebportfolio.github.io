My Website Portfolio

Savannah Bergin – 19218246. Submitted on 15/12/2020.
This is my Website Portfolio curated for CS6041 Interactive Media Workshop, as part of our Masters in Interaction and Experience Design.

Refection on web development process: 
It would be dismissive not to mention that building this website was a massive learning curve. During my International Exchange in my undergrad, I was taught to rely on bootstrap for creating a website. My approach and goal for this website was to curate a responsive portfolio website predominantly with HTML and CSS and evade relying on bootstrap. This learning process took weeks to learn new practices and drop previous methods I would have used. I was extremely grateful for online resources and the tutorials we were given the class to support me at times when I ran into complications with the code. From where I began, I would not have expected to have been able to create this finished output – I am so grateful for what I have learned during this project and what I am able to do now.  I amalgamated the different interactive media skills and competencies we have learned in our Interactive Media Workshop over the past few weeks to create my finished product. I aspire to improve on my web development skills that I have learned from this module, and add to my portfolio website over the coming months during my Masters Programme. 


Software and Technologies I used to create the website:
1.	Brackets for coding my website
2.	Google Chrome for previews, utilising the ‘inspect’ tool. 
3.	Canva for presenting my imagery and video content especially made for the website
4.	Shutterstock, iStock photo, and Dribbble for the homepage, audacity project, and video project landing pages main image
5.	Lighthouse Reports to check my portfolio website 
6.	Adobe Photoshop to re-size and process all of the landing page images 
7.	Adobe Illustrator to create the Logo 
8.	Ionic framework to link icons to different parts of my website
9.	GitHub Desktop to manage the website’s repository 

Content:
All of the content on the website is my own that I curated in Adobe Illustrator, Canva, and Photoshop, except for the video, audacity, and homepage background image. This was yet another timely task, and I utilised the skills I have learned over the course of this semester to elevate my content and capture the user’s attention immediately. The video and audacity background image were sourced from iStock photo and Shutterstock, and the homepage image was sourced from Dribbble. As you will be able to see from my website, I implemented image editing and processing to make them my own and tailor them to the content I was presenting. Links are below:

I have included the collection of additional resources I used to educate myself on how I could elevate my website’s code, style, and design. In terms of finding design and efficient  Information Architecture inspiration that I could potentially apply to my website, I spent hours going through YouTube tutorials and online resources, finding how I could layout my website to look appealing with the limited HTML and CSS I began with. From this, I noted different styling elements I had seen from a variety of youtuber’s examples that I really loved and aspired to implement in my own website.  The time cost of this task was huge, many of the videos extended over an hour long however mastering a unique styling layout for my own portfolio was something I always wanted to do, so I was adamant to commit a lot of time to learning new HTML and CSS techniques over the past few weeks.
