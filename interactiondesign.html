                        <span>Our Group Project- Doccufy:</span>        As part of the brief, we had to select a general area of research and  develop a response to that area using user centered interaction design principles that we learned and developed on during the course of the semester.

                <p>
                    <span>Our UCD Process & Teamwork:</span>
                        We worked on this project as a team of three, all coming from different disciplines and backgrounds. We amalgamated our skills together during the process of  brainstorming, body-storming, mind-mapping, sketching,  ideation, concept development and product prototyping to meet the final deliverable - A low to mid fidelity physical & digital prototype.

                    <p> 
                        <span>Reflection: </span> This project was a great learning opportunity that gave me first hand experience in the HCI design process. I learned about the concepts of ideation through practical use of design tools such as brainstorming and mind-mapping. I also refined my UCD exploration skills during the expansion and refining process that happens in design. I also enjoyed working on a team curating this project and its prototypes. Working collaboratively with people from different backgrounds and unique skillsets proved to be a fantastic experience, and we were delighted with the outcome of our project. We felt that despite only going as far as making a prototype, our idea is something that could have the potential to solve a real-life problem and have a positive impact on people's document management and efficient organisation. The evolution of our idea moving from mind map, through rough sketches and into prototype was an exciting glimpse into the future of what we have to offer in the world of human computer interactions.
